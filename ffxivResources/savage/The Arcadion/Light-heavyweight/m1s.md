## Detailed Fight Overview

### Quadruple Crossing

Same Bait Strat

Bait all proteans on intercardinals - DPS First, Supports Second.

Partner stacks on Cardinals in their safe spot - Light party stacks on East/West.

* Supports rotate counterclockwise to where the DPS took their protean.
* DPS rotate clockwise to the safe spot after baiting.

:::tip
This strat will be used on ALL Quadruple Crossings throughout the fight.
:::

### Double One-Two Paw

Left safe first:
Stand at Intercardinal clone's Left, move to Cardinal clone's Right.

Right safe first:
Stand at Cardinal clone's Right, move to Intercardinal clone's Left.

:::tip
Light Party and Partner Stacks are resolved in the same positions as Quadruple Crossing.
:::

### Leaping Quadruple Crossing

Resolved the same way as the first Quadruple Crossing. The only difference is where you treat north. NA Party Finder mostly does the mechanic facing True North.

:::warning
Boss Relative is not widely used. If boss relative, treat where the boss is facing as north.
:::

### Mouser 1

#### Platform Dodges

All 16 tiles in the arena will be hit at least once; 12 of them will be hit twice and break, leaving a zig-zag pattern of 4 remaining tiles from North to South or West to East. To dodge all of the hits, start on either of the two inner tiles that is next to the first one hit. Watch if the tile that is getting hit first gets hit a second time.

* If it gets hit only once, dodge into it after one hit.
* If it gets hit twice, dodge into it after one hit, then back into the other tile once the other is hit.

Notably, the SE inner tile is always hit before the SW inner tile. The zig-zag pattern will always be through the center two columns or rows.

#### Knock-ups and Knock-downs

The next part of the mechanic will knock-up (sending the player forward) or knock-down (same spot but unable to move or attack) all Supports or DPS. The paw-marker will dictate who is getting knocked up or down. Unlike Normal mode, the clone will always teleport directly behind the affected player's facing rather than dash from its current location.

* Left Arm Glowing + Reeling back = Knock-down
* Right Arm Glowing + Lunging forward = Knock-up

The person getting knocked up or knocked down will do the mechanic in their same tile no matter the version.

* If knocked up, stand in one corner of the safe tile and look at the opposite corner.
* If knocked down, you can look and stand anywhere in your safe tile.

When a player gets hit, an AoE attack is triggered in a "+" (plus) shape pattern from that player that will knock off anyone standing in it. This AoE will strike all tiles directly adjacent to the hit player's position in all cardinal directions. Non-marked players can simply stand on a tile diagonal from the marked person. 

### Clones

The initial Leaping One-Two and Leaping Quadruple Crossing are resolved the same way they were earlier. Make note of:

* Clone positions and their tethered mechanic.
* Jump directions and safe side order. Use True North as the reference.

Watch which clone is tethered after the first two mechanics go off. The mechanic it was tethered with will start to perform that mechanic from that clone.

#### Quadruple Crossing / Nail Chipper Clone

Resolved in the same fashion as same baits. Only difference is what role starts first.

* No-marker roles bait first, marked roles baits second. Stay away from marked players.
* Those who were unmarked, will get marked after their baits.
* The markered players need to stay away from other marked players until they resolve. They can be near the non-marked players.

#### Leaping One-Two Clone

Resolved in the same fashion as same baits. Only difference is an addition of light party stacks.

* As the room cleaves go off, light party stacks will appear on 2 players.
* Light party 1 north, light party 2 south of the boss. Use True North.

:::warning
Boss Relative is not widely used. If boss relative, treat where the boss is facing as north.
:::

### Mouser 2

Resolved the same way as Mouser 1 with an additional mechanic. The role that was not marked during Mouser 1 is marked for Mouser 2.

During each knock-up or knock-down, 2 sets of a wild charge or protean bait will occur for a total of 4. The order is random.

Protean Spreads are boss relative, left to right: Tank - Healer - DPS.

### Raining Cats

Two tethers spawn from the boss. These tethers are heavy-hitting cleaves that apply a vuln-up debuff to the tethered player. The players who get hit by the tether will not be able to take a second one without dying unless they have an invuln.  

Additionally, two Proximity-Based Stacks will target the closest and furthest players.

#### Stacks
* Group 1 will bait the close baits. Stand Southwest, inside the hitbox of the boss.
* Group 2 will bait the far baits. Stand Southeast, max melee, and out of the hitbox of the boss.

#### Tethers
* Melees take the 1st tethers to the Northwest and Northeast of the boss. 
  * Make sure to stand on the outer ring of the hitbox.
* Tanks take the 2nd tethers. The second set of tethers should be mitigated by the tanks.
  * Melees join their groups.
* The third and fourth tethers will be invulned by the tanks.

:::tip
This mechanic is generally skipped. It won't be seen unless there are a lot of deaths and low DPS.
:::

### Predaceous Pounce

Telegraphed AoEs and Dashes will appear in the arena from a clone. Additionally, the boss will do a Left/Right cleave as the clone dashes around the arena.

Do your best to avoid the AoEs and Dashes while keeping an eye on the boss's cleave pattern.

:::tip
Mechanic is generally skipped.
:::

### Enrage

The boss casts another Mouser, which will destroy the entire platform, wiping the party.
