## Detailed Fight Overview

Work in progress...

### Repeat mechanics

#### Poison Drop

Pairs are R+T and M+H.
For line out->in spreads, R spread north toward the wall and H spread south toward the wall.
For donut->intercard out, support spread clockwise or left facing the boss while DPS spread counterclockwise or right facing the boss.

#### Stage Combo

No coordination of dodges. All lines and cleaves are aligned with the inter-compass arrows around the edge of the arena for reference.

### Beat 1

The hearts emitted from the boss always rotate clockwise. All players should prioritize getting to 2 hearts ASAP without duplicating tower soaks. After towers, players with 2 or fewer hearts should gather south of the boss to share the stack marker.

### Alarm 1

Bee spawn locations and bait targets are randomized. Each player will eventually be targeted twice. Every strat includes a significant amount of "[use your] eyes" or YOLO. Using knockback immunity will help survive one difficulty dodge, at the cost of a short Damage Down debuff and a Slashing Vulnerability. A second hit is always lethal damage, barring tank invulnerability.

### Beat 2

4 players are assigned 0 hearts and 4 players are assigned 1 heart.
0-heart players will bait several puddles as a stacked group followed by two 0-heart players receiving a stack marker. Start South and rotate clockwise after each baited puddle. Overlapping the stacks does not deal significant bonus damage or hearts, so all four 0-heart players stack and the 8 applied hearts will be evenly distributed.
1-heart players start North and rotate clockwise to match the 0-heart players. 2 1-heart players will receive a spread marker and should move far away from all other players, while the remaining 1-heart players soak the two towers with support soaking the North or West tower and DPS soaking the South or East tower. The two towers will always spawn opposite of each other.

### Alarm 2

The first bees always spawn at cardinals but successive spawns rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. Support should prefer dropping puddles north at the wall and DPS drop south at the wall, but there is sufficient room to drop at West or East respectively if a previous puddle was dropped badly.

### Beat 3

Debuff timers identify defam detonation. Timers are shared per role.
Towers spawn in pairs flanking opposite cardinals; only one tower will be adjacent to your intercardinal spread marker, so use it to distinguish which tower to soak for your role.
The dodge from center to soak the tower is fast, and the boss will perform another stage combo in between the first and second sets of defams plus towers.

### Rotten Heart

Start on clockspots. Plan for heavy mitigations and all self-heals, particularly if the boss has multiple "simp" stacks which each add 10% damage. With high DPS, most or all of this mechanic can be skipped.
