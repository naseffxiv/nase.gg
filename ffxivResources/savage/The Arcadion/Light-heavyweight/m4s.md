## Detailed Fight Overview

### Witch Hunt

### Electrope Edge 1

### Electrope Edge 2

### Static Cannons

### Transition

Boss faces South. M+H spreads in north quadrants and R+T spreads in south quadrants.

### P2 Repeated Mechanics

#### Tails

Fire = large circle AOE. Dodge along the north edge of the platform for maximum safety/minimal distance.
Water = large KB originating from the red glowing dots on the arena floor.

The boss will charge one tendril then the other with both fire or both water and hold them until after the next mechanic.

#### Wicked Special

A wide cleave hitting the center of the room (flaming sword), or the sides of the room (lightning tendrils).

#### Mustard Bomb

Stack before tethers apply to enable tanks to easily pick up, then spread MTTM in the first row and RHHR in the second row. All non-tanks plant for the duration of the mechanic; tanks find the left-most (MT) or right-most (OT) undamaged player and pass the rot debuff to them then return to spread position.

### Sunset

Two of the four spawn circles will descend faster than the other two, indicating which clones will spawn first.
Stand center to bait puddles then dodge both half-room cleaves from the first two clones.

### Chain Lightning

Tower spreads TMHR north to south.
On each side, each sword will be safe exactly once but the two sides will have different patterns. Typing the order in /party chat may confuse players on the opposite side; use /say which will not reach players on the opposite platform.

Note: If raidbuffs were used during the transition sequence, they will come up as the telegraphs end. If players on one platform are prepositioned at the back-most sword, they will not reach players prepositioned at the front-most sword on the opposite platform and vice versa.

### Twilight

### Sunrise

Both jumping clones spawn at E+W and both will jump either diagonally to N+S or straight across to E+W. It is not necessary to track whether a specific clone is jumping to N or S.
