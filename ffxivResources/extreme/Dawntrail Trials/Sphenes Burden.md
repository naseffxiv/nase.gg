## Detailed Fight Overview

***


### Aethertithe

Queen Eternal will cleave one third of the arena: Left, Middle, or Right. This happens 3 times and each section will be hit 1 time in total. After each hit she will target both healers with a shared line stack. Stack together. Group 1 West, Group 2 East. During this the party takes consistent small damage.

***

### Laws of Wind

Both healers are targeted with a shared stack. On the Hourglass platform, put Group 1 on the upper left path, Group 2 on the lower right path. After this goes off, move center and wait for the chain debuff to appear. Dps will run to the North East, Supports to the South West. 
Once the chains are broken, dodge the Legitimate Force. This is 2 half room cleaves going off in the order that her hands glow. 
Finally position yourself at the edge of the platform matching the side the arrow on your character indicates. That is, if the arrow is on the east of your character, move to the east edge of the platform. 

***

### Divide and Conquer

Sphene will target players 1 at a time with a line AoE. Spread out around the boss Group 1 West, Group 2 East. From center: Healer, Ranged, Melee, Tank. Healers are center to heal better. After everyone has been hit, all locations that were hit goes off again at the same time. Move in any space that wasn't hit once you have been hit.

***

### Laws of Earth

Tornados spawn in the center of two platforms. Stand on the tornado to activate the levitation. (Standing on it again will deactivate the ability.) Move center and dodge both hits of Legitimate Force. As the 2nd hit resolves towers will spawn. Group 1 will take West towers, Group 2 will take east towers. Have supports middle, DPS outer, Melee front, Ranged back. (The timing is tight if your side is the second hit, sprint is good here!)

Gravitational Empire will give 1 defamation (Targeted AoE on a player) and 1 tether (that will be hit with a large conal AoE) to a player on each platform. Have the defamation player move to the edge of the arena (East or West) and slightly South. This avoids the Cleave and doesn't block the tower. The tether player moves to the North corner on their side. The remaining 2 players soak towers. 

Next every player receives a green meteor marker. Every player will be struck with a meteor twice. If you are standing on a platform, you will drop a boulder on the platform. If two boulders overlap, they explode and wipe the raid. Have all players drop the first boulder on the platform, and the second in the air. 

For "L Meteors" Tanks, Melee, and Healers will drop their boulders on the inner side of their platform. Tanks being all the way north, Melee behind them, Healers near the southern wall. Ranged players will drop their boulders near the center column of the platform, adjacent to the healer. 

After dropping the boulders, group south behind the Healers' boulders as Queen will throw orbs at players. The boulders block the orbs and explode. After the three inner boulders explode, hide behind the Ranged boulder for the final hit.

***

### Coronation

Queen will spawn four triangles, one on each cardinal of the arena. Each triangle will tether one of its bottom sides to a player. Move towards your triangle. For CW Coronation you will move CW from your tethers origin until you hit a marker. Markers will be at the edge of the arena cardinals and corners. A player tethered to the right side of the north Triangle will go to the North East corner. As this resolves every player is hit with a defamation (a large AoE centered on the player.) The positioning described resolves safely for this.

***

### Absolute Authority

Standard resolution and explination:
All players drop large ground AoEs centered on the players. Starting center, move North edge to edge for the first 3 AoEs. Then Group 1 goes West and Group 2 goes East. At this point either all DPS or all Supports will receive a flare marker (proximity based damage centered on the player). Melee flare players will stay in the northern corner. Ranged player will move along the wall to the center edge of the arena. The remaining four players move middle as one will receive a shared stack marker. 

Once the flares and stack marker resolve, every player is given a red triangle over their head. This denotes that the player cannot be alone or they will explode. The party at center stays still. The flare players on each side collapse to each other along the wall. 


You may see "Mit Authority". This is a strat where everyone stays stacked and mits the damage from all of the mechanics as there is no vulnerability up. The party starts stacked North West and moves in a straight line to North East, placing the puddles edge to edge. 


As all of this resolves the party starts taking continuous AoE damage and arrows appear on the floor. Either Surecast/Arms Length for knockback immunity or move to the front of the arena. 

***

### Laws of Ice

Players will have a count down ice icon appear above their heads. When the timer expires the players need to have continous movement for a few seconds or be frozen. 

Players now line up North to South, DPS on the East, Supports on the West. From North: M1, M2, R1, R2. Next either all DPS or all supports will be tethered to crystals on the edge of the arena. 

Players need to cross a bridge away from their crystal, however two players being on a bridge at the same time will cause it to break. A player tethered to a West crystal needs to go East. Players to the north get to move first. Melee always take the north platform, Ranged always take the South. (This means Group 1 players can always go immeadiately on being tethered as they have a higher priority.) While on the platform tethered to a South Crystal Move all the way north. The more West crystal player stays more West. Same for East crystal player.

Next a second set of tethers comes out targeting the other role. These crystals spawn East and West. Move away from your crystal across the bridge. The player tethered to the northern most side crystal positions betweent he two crystals on their side. The southern most side crystal positions closer to the south wall. 

As this resolves Queen casts Legitimate Force cleaving half the arena, then the other half in the sequence her hands started glowing. Everyone moves to the middle platform side crystal players  moving first. The further outside North players should take the southern bridge or wait for the inner player to cross. 

***

### Laws of Ice (2)


All players need to move for the freeze mechanic. As that resolves a healer will receive a stack marker and 2 random players will be targeted with tethers. Have melee move to the front of the platform to take tethers. Group 1 melee crosses to the West platform and moves all the way up. Group 2 does the same on the East. The party moves back to max melee. 

For MTTT tethers, tanks will take the next tethers. Then invuln the 3rd and 4th hits of tethers. (The tethers damage applies a vulnerability up.)

***

## Phase 2

***

### Radical Shift

Line marks appear on the floor. Platforms appear on the East and West in the air. There will be 2 distinct sets of outlines for these platforms, with different colors. Pay attention to the outside of the arena. It will be swirling either clockwise or counter clockwise. The platforms will move in the same direction. If the background is swirling clockwise, the East platform will be the new platform.

As the platform changes, players are knocked up and every player receives a personal AoE that goes off shortly after. Reference the images below for spread positions.
This will happen a 2nd time before the platform returns to normal.

***

### Dimensional Distortion

***


Exaflares (Large circle ground AoEs that move in a direction and repeat, indicated by arrows on the Aoe) will spawn north. There will be two sets, alternating columns. Stand in front of the second set to spawn and move either left or right to dodge into the 2nd hit of this exaflare.

Tyranny's Grasp. Queen will do a large AoE on the front half of the arena and spawn two towers. Tanks need to take these with cooldowns while the party just dodges the ground AoE. 

Queen will repeatedly slam the ground for heavy raid wide damage. Then a heavy multi-hit line AoE.

***

### Radical Shift (2)

This is the same as before, followed by enrage.
